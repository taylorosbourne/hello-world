# Hello World...

[*from Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)

A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Because it is very simple in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language and is often the first program those learning to code write.
